        <h3>Sweet!</h3><br>
	<p><div class=flash> Thanks for agreeing to present on -date-.  Here are a few tips 
	    to keep in mind:</div></p>
	<ul>
            <li>Aim to keep your presentation to ~10 minutes, and leave time for ~5 mins of 
	        discussion/questions for the audience.</li><br>
            <li>Keep in mind that not everyone is an expert on the topic, so be sure to 
	        provide context (why is this important?) and basic explanations where 
	        necessary.</li><br>
            <li>Have a minimum goal of conveying the main points presented in the paper, 
                as well as touching on main figures/numbers/etc.  Your criticism would be 
                an enhanced goal, which will likely come up in discussion.</li><br>
            <li>Try consulting <a href="http://cosmo.nyu.edu/ccppshareview.html">
                Mindshare</a>, or asking around if you are having trouble picking an 
                article.</li><br>
        </ul>
